# Poetic Text Generation with TensorFlow

Hey there! Today, I'm excited to share with you how I create poetic text using TensorFlow. It's a fascinating journey into the realm of language generation!

## Getting Started

To embark on this adventure, our trusty companion is **TensorFlow**, a powerful tool that allows us to dive into the depths of artificial intelligence. Specifically, we'll be utilizing its LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) capabilities to weave words into poetic tapestries.

### Installation

But first things first, let's ensure we have all the necessary tools at our disposal. Simply install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training the Model

Now that we've laid the groundwork, it's time to train our model. Head over to `main.py`, our training ground where we'll hone the craft of text generation. We've chosen to train our model with a selection of 500 thousand characters from the timeless works of Shakespeare, contained within `shakespear.txt`.

### Generating Poetic Text

Once our model is trained and ready to unleash its creative potential, it's time to witness the magic firsthand. Run `generate.py`, and watch as words dance across the page, forming intricate patterns of prose and poetry.

With TensorFlow as our guide, let's embark on this poetic odyssey together. Who knows what wonders await us as we delve deeper into the art of text generation? ðŸ“œâœ¨
